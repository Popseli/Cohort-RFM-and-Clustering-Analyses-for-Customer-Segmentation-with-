# Introduction
Customer segmentation is the practice of grouping customers based on common characteristics. These customer segments are beneficial in marketing campaigns, in identifying potentially profitable customers, and in developing customer loyalty. A company might segment customers according to a wide range of factors, including: demographics (age, gender, location etc), behaviour (previous orders, responses to messaging), psychographics (values, interests, lifestyles) etc.
